# BloFin Asset Manager

Manage assets across BloFin accounts — check balances, transfer funds between account types, and track deposit/withdrawal history.

## Account Types

BloFin has multiple account types for different purposes:

| Account | Code | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Funding** | `funding` | Main wallet for deposits and withdrawals |
| **Futures** | `futures` | Futures/perpetual swap trading (also used for unified accounts) |
| **Copy Trading** | `copy_trading` | Copy trading account |
| **Earn** | `earn` | Earn/staking products |
| **Spot** | `spot` | Spot trading |
| **Inverse Contract** | `inverse_contract` | Inverse contract trading |

**Typical flow:** Deposit to Funding → Transfer to Futures → Trade → Transfer back to Funding → Withdraw

## Available Tools (via blofin-mcp)

### get_asset_balances — Balances Across Accounts

Check balances for any account type.

```
Use get_asset_balances to see funds in a specific account.
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|:--------:|-------------|
| `accountType` | String | Yes | `funding`, `futures`, `copy_trading`, `earn`, `spot` |
| `currency` | String | No | Filter by currency, e.g. `USDT` |

**Key response fields:** `currency`, `balance` (total), `available` (can be used/transferred), `frozen` (locked).

1. **Always confirm transfer details** before executing — wrong direction transfers are instant
2. **Verify available balance** in source account before transferring

4. **Warn about withdrawal delays** — blockchain withdrawals require manual review and may take time
5. **Inform about withdrawal fees** before the user initiates a withdrawal
