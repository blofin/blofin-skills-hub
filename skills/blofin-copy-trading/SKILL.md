# BloFin Copy Trading

Manage copy trading operations on BloFin — both as a follower and as a lead trader. Copy trading allows users to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders.

## Overview

BloFin copy trading has two roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Follower** | Automatically copies trades from lead traders |
| **Lead Trader** | Trades are copied by followers; earns profit sharing |

Copy trading uses a dedicated account (`copy_trading`), separate from the main futures account.

**WebSocket:** `wss://openapi.blofin.com/ws/copytrading/private`

## Follower Workflows

### 1. Copy Trading Account Overview

Check copy trading account status:

1. **Get copy trading balance** — check funds in copy trading account
2. **Get copy trading positions** — view positions opened via copy trading
3. **Present account summary:**

```
Copy Trading Account
====================
Total Equity: $X,XXX

```

**Example prompts:**
- "Show my copy trading account"
- "What positions do I have from copy trading?"
- "How much is in my copy trading account?"

---

### 2. Fund Copy Trading Account

Transfer funds to start copy trading:

1. Use `get_asset_balances` with `accountType: "funding"` to check available funds
2. Use `fund_transfer` with `toAccount: "copy_trading"` to move funds

```
To start copy trading:
1. Transfer USDT from funding to copy_trading account
2. Select lead traders to follow on the BloFin platform
3. Set your copy parameters (amount per trade, max positions, etc.)
```

**Example prompts:**
- "Transfer 500 USDT to my copy trading account"

### 3. Monitor Copy Trading Performance

**Example prompts:**
- "How are my copy trades performing?"
- "Show my copy trading profit and loss"
- "Which lead trader is making me the most money?"

### 6. Lead Trader Risk Management

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** — begin with a small allocation to test lead traders before committing more
2. **Diversify** — follow multiple lead traders to spread risk
3. **Monitor regularly** — copy trading is not fully passive; check performance and adjust
4. **Set risk limits** — configure maximum loss per lead trader and per trade
5. **Understand fees** — lead traders may take a percentage of profits
6. **As a lead trader** — always use TP/SL to protect followers' capital; maintain consistent strategy
7. **Transfer back** — when stopping copy trading, transfer funds back to funding account via `fund_transfer`
